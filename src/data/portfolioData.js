      'An open-source, web-based dashboard tailored for AWS Lambda developers. It is meticulously designed to bridge the gap between managing Lambda functions and layers, simplifying AWS cloud operations. It enhances developing efficiency by allowing engineers to test their layer and function compatibilities in bulk.
